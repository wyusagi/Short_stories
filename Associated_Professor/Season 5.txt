Associate professor: "So what's your purpose?"
Associate professor: "Is this... namely, Story of Associate Professor 5th season?"
Lian[REDACTED]: "emmmmmmmm. Somehow."
Associate professor: "So why in English? Just for Zhuangbility?"
Lian[REDACTED]: "Reasons are complicated... Anyway there would be one day I have to write in English. The earlier I start, the easier it would be later."
Associate professor: "But your grammar is not accurate."
Lian[REDACTED]: "It's fine. I am writing as fast as I can. And there is no necessity to polish grammer. Wait... I hope you are not doubting if I would take another Toefl exam. I want to stay away from it...you know."
Associate professor: "Fine. I got your meaning."
Lian[REDACTED]: "Another reason, I think the programmers in Sb_du are too stupid to hexie English. BTW I want to write something that not everyone could understand."
Associate professor: "Are you going to write sth. yellow, or shameful?"
Lian[REDACTED]: "Not really. At least at this point."

Associate Professor left Lian[REDACTED]'s place. But he has nowhere to go.
It is because the the latter has no idea.
Then Associate Professor met little yellow yellow, his/her boy/girl friend.
Associate Professor: "F**k, is it so difficult to set up our gender?"
Lian[REDACTED]: "For who? For you and for me and the entire humanrace?"
Little yellow yellow: "I want little biscuit to be Futa!"
Lian[REDACTED]: "Oops, hentai yellow yellow! I can't admit this proposal."
Little yellow yellow: "Sodayo...That's so disappointing."
Associate Professor suddenly came up an idea for their dating: "Little yellow yellow, let's go to eat biscuit."
Little yellow yellow: "Where to go? Starf**k?"
Associate Professor: "Do you miss the Starf**k in the giant black hole in the center of galaxy? When we participated in the Galaxy Programming Championship..."
Little yellow yellow: "Yep of course! Little biscuit, I didn't know you are so romantic..."

Lian[REDACTED]: "Now you know why I am writing in English."
Lian[REDACTED]: "Just because I am unable to write romantic story in Chinese."
Lian[REDACTED]: "BTW, do not read this story if you are studying for any English exam."
Emmmm.... But I have already written for three floors, is it too late to post this warning message? Lian[REDACTED] is not quite sure
Associate Professor: "But you are not romantic at all, kusobaka!"
Little yellow yellow: "Little biscuit, don't be so angry. Let's go to the black hole Starf**k."
Then Associate Professor and Little yellow yellow took the Galaxy Shuttle/Fleet... anything, which is going to take them to center of the galaxy.
The universe is so beautiful! Associate professor admired the milky way outsides the prothole.
Lian[REDACTED]: "f**k. I do not think writing this way would improve my English. If I want, I should write sth. to my boss and let him help me polish it."
Associate Professor: "You got the truth."
Little yellow yellow: "Little biscuit, do you remember where we met for the first time?"
Associate Professor: "it was... when... when you asked me, which is better of TensorFlow and Keras?"
Little yellow yellow: "Bingo~ Then emmmm. Our discussion was interupted right?"
Associate Professor: "imifumei."
Associate Professor: "Do you want to continue the war?"
Little yellow yellow: "I don't think so because the stupid Lian[REDACTED] doesn't know which is better."
Associate Professor: "Agree----Look, the black hole is here!"
Because the gravity in the blackhole is so strong, Associate Professor had to carefully operate the shuttle. If the shuttle crashed, he would have to work in the Starf*ck for 114514 years for compensation.
Dad Xu: "Slow down! Slow down!"
Associate Professor: "Dad Xu? I remember you also participated in the programming champinship... How do you come to be a security guard here?"
Dad Xu: "Because I can do nothing but tunning parameter."
Associate Professor: "......"
Little yellow yellow: "......"

Sad story.
One week later, Lian[REDACTED] still doesn't know how to complete this story.
Lian[REDACTED]: "Awful feeling. It is awful to dig pits without filling them."
Dad Xu: "So give me a better job! I do not want to be a security guard."
Lian[REDACTED]: "Emmm? Aren't you satisfied with your salary? It is the central black hole! The richest place in the galaxy! You earn much more than those tubie in the solar system!"
Dad Xu: "Sounds good."
Associate Professor: "This guy is someone without dream."
Little Yellow Yellow: "Small cookie, do not comment on others' life style."
Then Associate Professor and Little Yellow Yellow went to Starf*ck to drink coffee.
If life raped you, just enjoy it!
